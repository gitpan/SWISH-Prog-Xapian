=head1 NAME

SWISH::Prog::Xapian - Swish3 Xapian backend

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # create an indexing program
 use SWISH::Prog;
 my $indexer = SWISH::Prog->new(
    invindex   => 'path/to/index.swish',
    aggregator => 'fs',
    indexer    => 'xapian',
    config     => 'path/to/swish.conf',
 );
 
 $indexer->index('path/to/files');
 
 # then search the index
 my $searcher = SWISH::Prog::Xapian::Searcher->new(
    invindex => 'path/to/index.swish',
    config   => 'path/to/swish.conf',
 );
 my $results = $searcher->search('my query')
 while ( my $result = $results->next ) {
    printf("%s : %s\n", $result->score, $result->uri);
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<STOP>: Read the L<SWISH::Prog> documentation before you use this
module.

SWISH::Prog::Xapian is a Xapian-based implementation of Swish3,
using the SWISH::3 bindings for libswish3.

See the Swish3 development site at http://dev.swish-e.org/wiki/swish3

=head1 Why Not Use Search::Xapian Directly?

You can use Search::Xapian directly. Using Search::Xapian via SWISH::Prog::Xapian
offers a few advantages:

=over

=item Aggregators and Filters

You get to use all of SWISH::Prog's Aggregators and SWISH::Filter support.
So you can easily index all kinds of file formats 
(email, .txt, .html, .xml, .pdf, .doc, .xls, etc) 
without writing your own parser.

=item SWISH::3

SWISH::3 offers fast and robust XML and HTML parsers 
with an extensible configuration system, build on top of libxml2.

=item Simple now, complex later

You can index your content with SWISH::Prog::Xapian,
then build a more complex searching application directly
with Search::Xapian.

=item Compatibility with swish_xapian

The C<swish_xapian> tool that comes as part of libswish3 should
generate compatible indexes. So you can create indexes with
SWISH::Prog::Xapian::Indexer and search them with C<swish_xapian>
and vice versa.
